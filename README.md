# Internship

# This project examines EEG data taken from an ALS patient. The goal is to investigate potential neurophysiological signatures of consciousness/cognition in these patients which could be used to identify temporal windows for effective BCI communication.

# Previous analysis has identified a brain rhythm (4.5-6Hz) which appears to manifest in two distinct brian states (high and low). Our strategy is to compare the neural responses to auditory stimulation in high vs low resting brain states.
