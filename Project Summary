Application of BCI devices for CLIS-ALS patients has so far failed to establish even basic communication. One explanation for this ineffectiveness is that the level of cognitive capacity in these patients may vary throughout the day. Previous work in this patient group identified a prominent power spectral peak at sub-alpha frequencies. The functional implications of this ostensibly downshifted alpha rhythm are unknown. The first aim of our project was to assess the neurophysiological properties of this enigmatic sub-alpha rhythm. To do this, we quantified the amount of event-related desynchronisation (ERD) to trains of auditory stimuli. We found no evidence of any significant ERD of the sub-alpha (4 – 6Hz) rhythm. Our second aim was to explore distinct brain states which may be associated with varying levels of cognitive function. We found that our patient possessed two distinct brain states associated with a prominent power spectral peak at either sub-alpha (4 – 6Hz) or high-alpha (10.5-12.5Hz) frequencies. Next, we explored state-specific responses to auditory stimulation and tested for between-state differences. Our results were inconclusive and so we could not infer whether these brain states conferred different levels of cognitive function to our patient. Looking forward, we suggest that an improved and expanded experimental setup may reveal important functional distinctions between these two brain states, with important ramifications for the development of improved BCI-based communication strategies.
